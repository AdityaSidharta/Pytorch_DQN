# TO-DO LIST

1. Allow prediction for continuous action spaces - Value iteration is not suitable for continuous action spaces

2. Allow observation spaces to have more than one dimension - the implementation of memory currently doesnt support that

3. Provide setup instruction and setup makefile

4. Convert notebook to python script
